 "Analysis of Patient Surveys: HCAHPS"

 This project centered on an in-depth exploration of data derived from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers Survey (HCAHPS), capturing patient viewpoints during hospital visits spanning 2015-2023.
 The HCAHPS encompassed 19 questions, categorically distributed over 10 vital measures including Communication with Nurses, Communication with Doctors, Hospital Staff Responsiveness, Medication Communication, Discharge Information, Care Transition, Hospital Environment Cleanliness, Noise Level, Overall Hospital Rating, and Likelihood of Recommending the Hospital.
Objective: The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".
Key Questions: Relevant inquiries included:
Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?
Project Description: Analyzing Patient Satisfaction Trends in Healthcare
This initiative encompassed a comprehensive analysis of the HCAHPS survey data over nine years. The objective was to dissect patient satisfaction trends, evaluate healthcare services, and provide actionable insights for elevated patient experiences.
Process:
Data Compilation and Preparation: The project began with the collection and organization of extensive survey data from 2013 to 2022. I carefully arranged this information, which included patents responses and feedback  about their time in the hospital.
Trend Identification: By harnessing the capabilities of Power BI, I created interactive visualizations that depicted trends and patterns in patient satisfaction scores. These visualizations enabled the identification of both positive improvements and potential areas of concern.
Insights and Recommendations: The visualizations provided valuable insights into various dimensions of healthcare, such as communication effectiveness, staff responsiveness, and post-discharge care. By analyzing these insights, I pinpointed specific measures and aspects that exhibited remarkable improvement, as well as those that demonstrated declining performance.
Enhancement Strategies: Based on the analysis results, I formulated recommendations to aid hospitals in elevating their quality of care.
